rewrite-chat: true

# Whether FreedomChat should claim to clients that secure chat is enforced.
# With this set to true, the "Chat messages can't be verified" toast will not
# be shown. This is, in default configurations, unrelated to allowing clients
# not signing their messages join. In modern versions, clients also
# require a valid access token to be present for the toast to be hidden.
# That being said, you may still see the toast even if this option is enabled.
# Note that enabling this option may violate a clause
# in Minecraft's usage guidelines - 
# "[You cannot] hide or alter any of the dialogs or prompts that are part of
# Minecraft (this includes the End User License Agreement (EULA),
# warning messages, and error messages)"
# - so use this option at your own discretion.
# See https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/usage-guidelines for more information.
